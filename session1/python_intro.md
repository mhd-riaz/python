# PYTHON
## Lecturer : Chitra G

### Why Python? 
out of popularity, robust libraries for Ai & ML.

**Key notes**:
- dynamically typed language

- has no restriction with the int

- floats are a bit cumbersome, as `0.3` will be interpreted as `0.3000000000001` due to memory allocation

- multi variable initialization and assignment
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

# op: a = 1; b = 2; c = 3;
```

- `help(print)` : help provides info on built-in function

- `dir(__builtin__)` : show list of available builtin functions

- `import` : used to consume something written outside of the file/function
```python
# example for import
import math # one time per file
math.e
# op: 2.7182
```

- to see whats inside the math do `dir(math)` after importing

- to see definition of each method or variable inside math class, use `help(math.factorial)`
