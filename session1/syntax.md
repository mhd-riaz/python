## code blocks
use indentation instead of flower brackets to represent a code block, as python is a heavily indented programing language

## Comments
```py
# - for single line comment
'''
for block comment
'''
```

## Variables

- Python does not have variable declaration, A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
```py
a = 12
x = "riaz"
```

- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
```py
x = 'riaz'
x = 123
```

## Type casting

- changing variable into different data type
```py
x = int(3) # 3
y = float(3) # 3.0
z = str(3) # '3'
```
